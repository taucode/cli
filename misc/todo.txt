==========
    1. Consider Sasa.Parsing https://sourceforge.net/projects/sasa/

2020-01-06
==========
    1. Lexing will fail on:
db sd -c / - c .

2020-01-18
==========
x   1. Lexer implementation produces weird exception "Unexpected char '<foo>'". Meanwhile, '<foo>' itself might be fine, it is the whole token who produces error.
x   2. UT kubectl (including port forwarding) and curl, and others.
+   3. Support integer args
x   4. Support help for hosts, add-ins and executors.

2020-01-31
==========
x   1. Consider 'NotSetTextWriter' to designate that Host's output was not set.

2020-03-24
==========
x   1. Add 'ConnectionStringProducer' since 'PathProducer' isn't good at connection strings.

2020-08-25
==========
+   1. CliWeorker is not much good (confusing with TauCode.Working library); consider CliExecutor (e.g.).

2021-05-08
==========
x   1. Email text class
+   2. Consider async.
x   3. Resurrect knowledge about fallbacks.
x   4. TinyLisp supports json

2022-06-16
==========
+   1. Consider elements (alternatives) (optional) (repeatable) and stuff
+   2. No mandatory :is-entrance, :is-exit in sequences
+   3. Get rid of 'Finalize vertices' concept.
+   4. Mind TokenProducerBase which checks context and stuff.
    5. Support -- concept:
            E.g.:
                *   tau email send ... -a 'c:/temp/file.jpg' --subject      => will fail: --subject is tokenized as a legal key, not file path
                *   tau email send ... -a 'c:/temp/file.jpg' -- --subject   => will pass: file.jpg will be attached with local name '--subject' which is weird but legal.
                    maybe ITokenConverter should depend on current IParsingResult which in case of CLI library will keep info about consumed --.
        Note: this might require IParser implementation's PreProcess concept. e.g. if this Parser meets '--', it does changes to IParsingCommand and goes on
        without feeding the token to a node.

2022-06-22
==========
x   1. Get rid of ReadOnlyMemory<char>.

2022-07-29
==========
    1. Executor might want its own Lexer. E.g. ComSpec emulation
